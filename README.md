# Huffman-Coding

  _Idiomatic Haskell_ implementation of the classic Huffman Compression Algorithm.
  
  This is an attempt to achieve the most Haskell-like solution, while keeping the code short and comprehensive.
  
***

## Usage:
1. Build the project with: `stack build Huffman-Coding`
2. Enter the name of text file in the current directory to be compressed.
3. Resulting compressed file has naming: `<input_file>.huffman`

***

## Supported features:
1. Encoding/Decoding of the initial text file.
2. Serialization/Deserialization of the encoded contents to/from a binary file.

***

## TO-DO:
1. Make use of ByteSting instead of String.
2. Test the solution via QuickCheck.
